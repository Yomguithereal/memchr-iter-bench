# Notes

* Using `criterion` & `criterion-table`.
* Only testing `sse2` for the time being, because I expect it would be the least performant.
* The task is to find *all* matches, not the first one.
* Various loop/iter don't seem to have significant differences.
* Only single needle yet, but I expect the difference to be even better with more needles.
* The PR is incorrect.
